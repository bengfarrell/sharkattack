            "description": "Scary Squids is a music review site, created and maintained by me (Ben Martin). I like reviewing albums, and plan to start sharing new (and old) music that I like on this site. While I am a music listener first and foremost, I also have recorded some albums. One is called “Days and Dreams” and it’s a solo record, and another is called “Voices”, and it’s an instrumental rock record I did with a band called Room For A Ghost.",
